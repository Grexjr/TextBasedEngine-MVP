NEXT MOVE 7/10/25: ADD PROPER BATTLE EXITING!!!
--- This may involve making a window separate from the battle window with extra choices for the player. Let's try it!
--- Will also likely involve a SceneManager object that stores the story scene to return to it after
--- Also should create a wrapper gamePanel class that all the panels of the game inherit from that has the text log etc.

--- Text log now appears below the button panel
